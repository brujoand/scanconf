Scandinavian Developer Conferences

I had a need to find developer conferences in Scandinavia, but
I couldn't find a reliable source. This is my attempt at making
one. It should be live over at https://scanconf.com/

I'm colorblind and frontend scares me, so please feel free to make it prettier.
Also if you see something that's missing or should be added please fork, add and
create a PR. The file /docs/data.json is where all the data is stored.
